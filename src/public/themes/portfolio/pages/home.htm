    I am a full-stack developer in heart and soul, this is also evident from the fact that I've been programming since I was twelve years old. I'm open to learn new techniques and put those into practise, I also love to share my knowledge with other developers. I know HTML(5), Scss, Javascript, Vue.js, PHP, Laravel and C#. During development I also pay attention to SEO.

    In my spare time I'm probably playing games, playing tabletop RPG's with my friends and working on my own programming projects. I recently got into 3D printing and will be sharing my experiences on here as well.
